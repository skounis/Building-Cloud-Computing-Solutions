# Cloud Virtualization, Containers and APIs
[Cloud Virtualization, Containers and APIs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-virtualization-containers-api-duke/) - Duke University

## Week I
### Overview
* Virtulization and Containers
* Spot Instances
* Docker format containers
* Kubernetes
* Microservices
* DevOps best practices
* Monitoring and Logging

#### Learning Objectives
* Evaluate virtualization and container technology
* Develop effective and efficient technical solutions with Microservices
* Evaluate effective technical operations stategies using Cloud development best practices.

#### Prerequisitied
* Python
* Linux
* IT Infrastructure 
* JSON and YAML

### Project
* Containarized Flash Microservice
* Managed container service
    * Cloud run: Fully managed container service on GCP
    * EKD: Container platform on AWS (Kubernetes environment)

## Week II
### Virtual Machines
* Containers vs VMs
* Spot Instances
* GCP VM

#### Objects
* Evaluate virtualization abstractions
* Build solutions with VMs

#### Key terms
* Container
    * Cloud native applications
    * DevOps best practices
    * Includer runtime with code
    * Launch time in miliseconds 
* Virual Machines
    * Used for monolithic applications
    * Run OS inside of another OS
    * Launch time from seconds to minutes
* Docker format container
    * Flat file with instructions / directives
    * Can live inside the source countrol
    * Launch time from seconds to minutes

#### Containers vs VMs
* VMs: Guest and Host OSs
* VM: Full operating system.
* VM: suitable for monolithic application
* VM: Convert from a physical machine
* VM: Lift and shift of legacy applications
* Container: Host and a subset of an OS for guest. More like an process than an OS. Mor lightweight, smaller, faster.
* Container: Good fit for DevOps best practices, continuous integration, micro services.
* Key difference: Portability
