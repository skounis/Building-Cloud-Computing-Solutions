## Week II
> talent is one aspect, but it's not the most important aspect of an effective team

> If there is no goal, it's really hard to have an effective team

Ideas of what it takes to be effective in terms of a team
1. Clear, Elevating Goal
2. Results-Driven Structure
3. Competent Team Members
4. Unified Commitment (Is everyone on the same page)
5. Collaborative Climate
6. Standards of Excellence 
7. External Support and Recognition
8. Principled Leadership

### Effective Technical Project Management
Learning Objectives
1. Identify primary factors that influence the success of a technical project
2. Cultivating positive team dynamics through transparent and timely communication

Key principles 
* **Quarterly schedule** that identifies week by week what it is that you'll build.
* **Weekly Demo**: _If you can't demo each week you probably not going to hit your deadline_
* The code is **always in a deployable state**.
* **Automated testing**: **If it is not automated, it is broken**
* Tickets sweet spot: 4 hours to 3 days time window
* Avoid the hero, _who jumps in and save the day_ (hero-drived development)
* Kaizen, from Japanese Automobile Industry: Continuous Improvement

Anti-patterns 
1. Hero-Driven development
2. Crisis-Driven development
3. HiPPO-Diven development (Highest-paid person's opinion, e.g CEO. Investor, ...) 
4. Heavy SCRUM: Mimic what appears to be succesful. 
5. Faith in people vs. Faith in process.


> Hope is not a strategy

* Integration
* Load

> Linting: Catches bugs before they happen. 

Python Virtual Env:
* Isolates Python to a directory
* Best practice


GitHub Actions
* Continuous Integration: Form of automated testing.
* SaaS based continuous integration server
